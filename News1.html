As you approach someone on the street, you try to move out of the way but she steps in the same direction. Why do we engage in this sidewalk dance?<br>

Walking down the sidewalk, you notice a person coming directly toward you. As you near each other, you realize you’re going to collide.<br><br>

You step to the right.<br><br>

The other person steps to the left.<br><br>

Now you’re in each other’s way — again. Then you shift to the left and she moves right and you’re in a standoff. After moving back and forth, you finally stop and let her pass.<br><br>

This phenomenon, a sidewalk dance of sorts, seems to happen all the time.<br><br>

Why are people always stumbling into one another’s path?<br>
“It is definitely something that everyone has experienced,” Brett Fajen, professor of cognitive science at Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute in Troy, New York, told TODAY. “For pedestrian behavior, the rules are implicit. It is unlike driving where there are explicit rules that people are supposed to know and follow.”<br><br>

Social norms determine pedestrian behavior, which breeds misunderstandings (er, missteps). In cultures where personal space isn’t as important, people might walk closer to someone before swerving out of the way. In the U.S., people want loads of personal space and that influences how we stroll down the sidewalk.<br><br>

“We tend to avoid collisions with other people by giving them a larger berth,” said Fajen. “We give people more personal space than we would a telephone pole or an inanimate object.”<br><br>
