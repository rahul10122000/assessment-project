IANS had reported that the whistleblower claiming to be an employee in the company's finance department said that Mr Parekh kept visiting the US every month in order to retain his Green Card status.

"I have also heard that he has on several occasions gone to the US but has not visited any client or our offices. Then, what is the purpose of his visits? It is evident that he is telling you a lie," said the whistleblower in an unsigned and undated letter to the company's Chairman and co-founder Nandan Nilekani and Independent Directors on the Board.
